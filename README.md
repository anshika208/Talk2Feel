# Talk2Feel 

A React based chat app using chatengine.io Rest API and has features of creating groups and Sign-In with any valid Google Account. As the mental health of people is becoming a major issue now-a-days therefore  this project is created keeping in mind the idea of giving a platform to the people where they can share their worries and thoughts with anyone online and do not need to reveal their identity as well as other personal data.
All those who will register in the app will be showed in the suggestions for adding in a group . Anybody can choose any person randomly out of the registered users and can start chatting with just merely authenticating by their google account. In this way people can stop being bothered about being judged and can anonymously share their thoughts and feelings with anobody online.
